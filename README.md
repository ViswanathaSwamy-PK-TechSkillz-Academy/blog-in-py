# blog-in-py

I am learning building Blog site using Python Django from different Video Courses, Books, and Websites.

## Few Commands

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

python -m pip install Django~=5.0.4
python -m django --version

django-admin startproject blogposts
```

## Few Points

> 1. Django follows the MTV (Model-Template-View) pattern.
> 1. Model: This defines the logical data structure and is the data handler between the database and the view.
> 1. Template: This is the presentation layer. Django uses a plain-text template system that keeps everything that the browser renders.
> 1. View: This communicates with the database via the model and transfers the data to the template for viewing.
